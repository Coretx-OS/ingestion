Scope: First-run copy + guided test capture + “operating manual” micro-help.

First-run screen
Title: Your Second Brain is ready

Body:

Capture one thought at a time (no organising).

I’ll file it into People / Projects / Ideas / Admin.

If I’m unsure, I’ll ask you — I won’t guess silently.

Fixing mistakes is one tap.

Buttons:

Try a test capture

Skip

Guided “Try a test capture” flow
Step 1 — Enter a thought
Placeholder examples (rotate):

“Admin: renew domain by 2026-01-14”

Button: Send

Step 2 — Show result
If filed:

Title: <Title>

Confidence: <0.xx>
Buttons: Fix, View log

If needs review:

“I’m not sure where this belongs.”

Optional: “Add one detail…”

Step 3 — Teach Fix
Tooltip: “Wrong bucket or wording? Tap Fix — it updates instantly.”

Tiny operating manual (Settings → Help)
The only rule: One thought per capture.

If you fall off: Don’t catch up. Just restart with a 2-minute brain dump.

Trust features:

Every capture is logged

Low confidence asks you first

Fix is one tap

Permissions expectation (plain language)
“We only use page title + URL + optional selected text to help file your thought.”
